# Structure_Clumpp_Spatial_inference_R
Rmarkdown scripts and test files for running STRUCTURE analysis, combining replicates with CLUMPP, and generating assignment barplots and spatial interpolation of ancestry coefficient. The map of spatial interpolation of ancestry is similar to those generated by TESS, but the geographic information is not used by STRUCTURE to infer population ancenstry. 

Contents:
0.1 load librarie
0.2 load genotype data and stratification schemes
0.3 Map the data points
0.4 Structure analysis
0.5 get map information and set up map structure
0.6 Run clumpp on structure iterations, plot barplots and map spatial interpolation of ancestry coefficient from STRUCTURE
